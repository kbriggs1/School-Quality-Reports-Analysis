# School-Quality-Reports-Analysis

Created a school quality report pipeline during 6 month internship with New Visions for Public Schools:
<p>
  1) Extracts reports from AWS REdshift database.
  2) Cleans data and set years to each year a report was extracted from. 
  3) Changed titles of data tables to make sure they are readbable and added new changes to most recent year (2019).
  3) Pushed tranformed tables back to Reshift.
