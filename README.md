# School-Quality-Reports-Analysis

Created a school quality report pipeline during 6 month internship with New Visions for Public Schools:

 <p> 1) Extracts reports from AWS REdshift database.
                <p>
  2) Cleans data and set years to each year a report was extracted from. 
                  <p>
  3) Changes titles of data tables to make sure they are readbable and added new changes to most recent year (2019).
                    <p>
  4) Pushes tranformed tables back to Reshift. 
                     <p>
  5) Automated a web scraping script that scrapes the most recent and updates school quality report based on recent year then updates Data Analysis team via Slack.
